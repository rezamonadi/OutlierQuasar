## Project Summary
Given a catalogue of 750,414 quasars, we will use four different outlier detection methods to identify those quasars 
that are very different from the majority of quasars' population. Finding these outlier quasar gives insight into future research opportunities by proposing a modification for current astronomical models for quasars. 
## Scientific Background 

Quasars are a class of galaxies with a super massive black hole at the center. The black hole devours surrounding materials and converts them to electromagnetic radiation 
in different wavelengths. We call this 1D image a *quasar's spectrum*. This spectrum has some absorption and emission  
features that maybe different throughout quasars due to their different physical conditions.

## Scientific Justification
The main purpose of this project is to find those quasars which are less similar to the typical normal quasars. 
These outliers can be simply some objects that are mistakenly classified as a quasar in the main catalog or they can be the
representative of a class of very interesting objects that current astronomical models cannot explain. 
In either cases identifying outliers will be beneficial. We are going to use a variety of outlier detection 
algorithms for identifying outliers. In this case we can compare the results of each algorithm and be  confident 
when more algorithms are consistent about a particular quasar as an outlier. 
Because the overall shape of the 1D image of a quasar (spectrum) depends on its color, we separate quasars 
first based on their colors and then identify outliers in each class.

## Data 
The latest quasar catalogue ([dr16q](https://www.sdss.org/dr16/algorithms/qso_catalog/)) includes lots of information 
about individual quasars obtained by analyzing their spectra. 
We also have access to the spectra of individual quasars in dr16q publicly available in Sloan Digital Sky Server webpage ([SDSS](https://www.sdss.org/dr16/spectro)).

## Evaluation 

- There are previous outlier analyses performed on former quasars catalogs. We can compare our results with them. 
- Outliers in each class should be visually inspected by looking their spectra to see why they have been labeled as outliers. We do this by
    stacking the individual 1D images of all quasars in each cluster and compare 
    it with median 1D image of a normal quasars which there are many of them in the data set.

- The output of different algorithms we are implementing might be different. This let us to compare the performance of each algorithm. 
    


## Labour division

The data set has 750,414 quasars with 183 features. However, we will use a subset of relevant features as our study.
We need to pre-process the feature space by feature selection and normalization. Then we will apply the following outlier analyses:

1) **Reza Monadi**: Implementing Kohonen self-organized maps to reduce the dimentionality of data and find outliers. 
2) **Hasin Us Sami**: Implementing Density-Based Spatial Clustering to detect outliers.
3) **Arman Irani**: Isolation forest
4) **Terrance Kuo**: Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering


## Relation to Reza Monadi's thesis project
One of the projects in my thesis is about studying extremely red quasars (ERQs). The main purpose of ERQ project is to see if ERQs are outlier or just extreme cases of the main population. Our data set here, however, is different and the type of outlier we are going to find is not known before hand. Moreover, the physical parameters which build our feature space is different here. This project can help me if we find some outliers that happen to be also ERQs.
